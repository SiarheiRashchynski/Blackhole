# Blackhole

Just as a black hole in space pulls in everything that comes near it, leaving no trace behind, the BlackHole app does the same with your files. It creates a gravitational field in the form of a decoy folder on your system, pulling in files saved to it.

Once a file crosses the event horizon of this decoy folder, BlackHole swiftly transports it through a wormhole to a hidden galaxy - a concealed folder in the vast universe of your file system. Here, the file is encrypted, as if it’s being compressed to a singularity, and then it vanishes from the decoy folder, leaving no trace behind.

Restoring the files is like unlocking the mysteries of a black hole. You need to know the exact coordinates - the name of the hidden folder - and the password, which acts as the key to deciphering the complex encryption. There’s no star map to guide you to these hidden galaxies; only those with the correct information can navigate their way.

BlackHole is perfect for those who prioritize data security and privacy. It’s more than just a file storage system - it’s a journey through space, ensuring that your sensitive data is safe in the hidden galaxies of your system. Enjoy the confidence that comes with top-tier file protection with BlackHole.
